# To-Do
- Bundle localization resources
  - Likely requires a PR for Druid, though I likely could do it manually as well
  - https://github.com/linebender/druid/issues/1815
- Program icons
  - File icons
    - ~~Windows~~
      - Using `winres`
    - macOS
      - https://github.com/akeru-inc/xcnotary
    - Linux
      - May not be possible - Linux program icons seem to be done separate from the executable
  - Window icons
    - ~~Windows~~
      - https://github.com/linebender/druid/pull/2119
      - https://github.com/linebender/druid/issues/1162#issuecomment-1009864303
    - macOS
    - Linux
  - https://github.com/burtonageo/cargo-bundle
- Set the Windows Registry key for creating symlinks automatically on Windows
- Actually hide the hidden loadouts instead of just disabling them (greying them out)
- Material(ish) theme with no rounded corners or gradients
- ~~Create CHANGELOG.md~~
  - Go back through commit history and record the changes along the way
